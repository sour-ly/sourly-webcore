			<p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
				Sourly aims to be a multi-platform application that allows users to
				create, log, and track the progress on their skills through
				gamification. Sour-ly rewards users with EXP and levels up their skills
				(and themselves) as they progress. Skills can be anything from learning
				a new language, to improving your social skills, or even learning how to
				play an instrument. Skills are leveled up by assigning goals to them.
				Completing goals will reward the user and the skill with EXP.
			</p>
			<p>What You Can Expect Right Now:</p>
			<p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
				You can expect to be able to create, manage, and track your skills. You
				can also create goals for your skills and track your progress on them.
				Tracking your progress will reward you and your skill with EXP.
				Collecting EXP will eventually level up your skill and yourself.
			</p>
			<p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
				You can also expect to be able to view your profile and see your
				progress. You can also expect to be able to view the progress of other users on the application. However, you cannot interact with them (yet).
			</p>
			<p>What You Can Expect In The Future:</p>
			<p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
				On top of the current features, you can expect to be able to create and
				join co-working virtual spaces, compete with other users, and partner up
				with other users to complete goals together. You can also expect to be
				able to collect items and be able to customize your working space and
				your profile.
			</p>
			<p>What We Need From You:</p>
			<p style={{ fontWeight: 300 }}>
				We need you to test the application and provide feedback. We need you to
				report bugs and suggest features. We need you to be patient with us as
				we work on the application. We need you to be open to change and open to
				new ideas. We need you to be a part of the community and help us grow.
