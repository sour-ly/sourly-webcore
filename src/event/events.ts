/* PROBLEM: How do we implement the event system in a way that handles absorbing events and making sure things aren't passed before they're absorbed?
 * SOLUTION?: maybe we should have a queue of normal events and a queue of absorbed events; this means that events that are not really data dependent but are more like signals can be absorbed. However, things that are data dependent such as a goal being completed should not be executed before any of the absorbed events
 * We shouldn't require the developer to implement the same redundant logic for every event that can be absorbed, this will lead to alot of bugs down the road.
 */

/* HOW TO USE:
 * Define a event as normal wherever, and then somewhere else listen for the event and do something with it; if you want to have the ability to cancel (absorb) the event before it is emitted (and subsequently the more data dependent listeners) then you should use the absorbableOn method to listen for the event
